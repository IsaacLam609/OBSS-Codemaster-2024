# OBSS-Codemaster-2024
### Technology: Python, WebSocket

Codemaster is an inter-university coding competition held by OBSS that took place March 2024. It included questions on algorithms and sector-oriented tasks.


## Question 1: WebSocket Client Application
- Develop a client application that communicates with a server using WebSocket.
- The application has to send the given text to the server character-by-character.
- The message should start with "/" and each character should be translated into Morse code with its index.
- The client should wait for an acknowledgement message (which is the character being sent) from the server before sending the next character.
- After the server has received the correct message, it will respond with a UUID text in the form of Morse.

## Question 2: Graph Traversal
- In a garden, there are different types of flowers, each type identified by a unique letter.
- The gardener can only fertilize the same type of flowers that are directly next to each other (side-by-side or front-to-back, but not diagonally) in one step.
- The aim is to figure out the smallest number of steps needed to fertilize all the flowers.
